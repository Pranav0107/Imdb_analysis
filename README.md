1.	Understand the data by having a glimpse of first and last few rows.
2.	Identify for binomial or multinomial distribution.
3.	Clean the data by removing unwanted texts, characters (Pre-processing)
4.	Split the data into – training data and test data
5.	Invoke TF-IDF function to classify the given text and associated sentiment.
